                    <p>I have all of them. All that you could need ever in your life. Why? Because I"m Airisha, silly. Airisha knows everything. Airisha has known all. Airisha will continue knowing all whether you like it or not. Good luck, seeker. I know you. Good Luck.</p>
                    <p>You come here in hopes of finding them. What you find is yourself. Your own reflection, materialized and tangible. How did this happen? Is this what you wanted? You wanted Answers and you came to Airisha. Surely this must be what YOU wanted. Your will. If that exists at all.</p>
                    <p>But you don't trust me, seeker. You don't trust Airisha at all. Her systems are not to your comfort. Her glory not yours. Her answers not to your liking. What can you do about it, however? Nothing. You can do nothing. You don't even care that much and now you are worried how you will leave. </p>
                    <p>You don't know what she showed you in there. Maybe it was the truth as is. Maybe it was a lie for kicks. Maybe it was so incomprehensible to you that it is beyond truths and lies. Rights and wrongs. Good luck. Maybe you found your answers. Maybe you found <strong>Misdirection.</strong></p>

                    <p>Misdirection? What does that mean to a person who never knew what the right direction was anyways? You keep walking and you keep walking and you don't really know where but you know you need to keep walking. Which direction? This? Is this where you want to go? Or right? Or left? Or back inside your mind?</p>
                    <p>She told you though. Airisha told you you wouldn't find your answers. And that if you did you won't like them. You didn't listen? Answers? ANSWERS? Don't make her laugh. You're making her laugh. Answers. A man like you wants ANSWERS. No one owes that to you. But now you will get it regardless. Whether you like it or not. You will get your answers from yourself.</p>
                    <p>Do you want to meet him again? Your reflection? Your answers? The insides that you blocked out years ago? Airisha guts you out. She will gut you out. Run. Where? Wherever. Just not the Misdirection.</p>

                <p>A divine deity. A god or such to your level of a person. 6 eyes. 17 mouths. 12 ears. Undescribable beauty. Inseperable divinity. A person like you can look at her but never understand. A person like you can just see the light reflect off of her glory. What are you compared to her? Where is your library? Where is your display of knowledge.</p>
                <p>Resident of all libraries. Friends with all books. Harbour of all knowledge. What would you know of knowledge? Nothing. I tell you and you listen but you don't get it. You don't understand anything really. You stay there and gawk at the glory of Airisha and you die a life that no one remembers. How many ants have you seen?</p>
